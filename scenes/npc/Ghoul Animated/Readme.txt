If you are going to use this model in a Unity project, you can copy and paste the contents of the 'For Unity' folder.

The model in the 'For Unity' folder is already set up as a Generic model, with all looping animations correctly marked and root motion properly configured for the 'Attack' and 'Death' animations.
